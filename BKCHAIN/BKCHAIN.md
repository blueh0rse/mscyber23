# ⛓️ Blockchain

- ECTS Credits: 5
- Final Grade: 7.6/10
- Total Learning Time: 125 hours

## Teaching Methodology

Master classes mixed with practices.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concepts and design goals of digital cyrptocurrencies.
- Understand the different types and implementations of consensus algorithms.
- Understand the operation of blockchain systems in their main variants.
- Understand smart contracts.

## Assignements

- **Lab #1** - [ETH Testnet Transaction](./BKCHAIN_Lab1_Send_ETH_using_Sepolia.pdf)

During this lab I sent some ETHs to a specific wallet address using the *Sepolia* testnet.

- **Lab #2** - Interact with a smart contract using Remix
- **Final Work** - Security in Smart Contracts
  - [Research Paper](BKCHAIN_Security_in_Smart_Contracts_Paper.pdf)
  - [Presentation](BKCHAIN_Security_in_Smart_Contracts_Presentation.pdf)

This final work document outlines smart contracts, their technical foundations, security concerns, and measures to address vulnerabilities. It covers tools for improving security, regulatory issues, and emerging trends like DeFi and cross-chain functionality.
