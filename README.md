### 🚦 Traffic Monitoring & Analysis

- ECTS Credits: 5
- Total learning time: 125h

The objective of this subject is to study the main techniques, technologies and tools for monitoring and analyzing the network traffic,
and their applications to cyber-security. The course will review the main approaches to measure the Internet (passive and active
monitoring), the techniques used for identifying the traffic of applications and services (traffic classification), and methods employed
for network security, such as the detection and mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using Machine Learning. It
will also address the main technical challenges involved in network monitoring due to the ever-increasing link speeds and volume of
network traffic. Finally, it will discuss about the privacy and ethical implications of measuring network traffic, as well as current
regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
