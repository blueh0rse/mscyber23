# Master of Cybersecurity

## Application Security

### Teaching Methodology

The course is very interactive with subjectsâ€™ presentations from the Professor and assignments in which students present topics and discuss conclusions. Furthermore, some topics are complemented with laboratory sessions.

Concerning class assignments, there is one for analysis and discussion on specific advanced topics and standards, focusing either on research issues or software development or application. Students make a small research project led by the Professor (on a specific topic: what is done? what is not solved? ideas to solve it). They write a short paper and make a presentation where they answer questions and criticisms from the Professor and the other students. In addition, students lead a discussion on their results with the
rest of students.

Laboratory work consists on the design and development of applications taking into account the principles of Security by Design and Privacy by Design. The students have to work in teams in order to provide a secure version of their application. The kind of applications to be implemented has to be based on some of the use cases presented in the course. 

### Learning Objectives

This subject on Applications Security covers advanced aspects of the very active area of Internet applications, its development and its security. Focus is not restricted to a specific sector, but some are used as examples, such as eHealth and multimedia applications.

With this main objective in mind, security and privacy are considered for application protocols, information or content formats, metadata, etc. Many aspects of security for Internet applications will be reviewed, including techniques for development of secure software.

Standards to achieve interoperability are key for understanding the relevant problems and their solutions, so they will be studied.

Topics will be introduced, analyzed and discussed, focusing on the new approaches and techniques. Students will work on specific assignments that will be discussed with their peers in order to understand current solutions and think on alternative ones.
