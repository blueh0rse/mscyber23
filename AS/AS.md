# üåê Application Security

- ECTS Credits: 5
- Final Grade: 6.2/10
- Total Learning Time: 125 hours

## Teaching Methodology

The course is highly interactive, featuring lectures, student-led presentations, and lab sessions. Assignments involve researching advanced topics, writing short papers, and leading discussions. Lab work focuses on applying principles of Security by Design and Privacy by Design to develop secure applications.

## Learning Objectives

The course aims to provide a deep understanding of security and privacy in Internet applications. It covers application layer protocols, metadata, secure software development, and standards for interoperability. Students are encouraged to critically analyze current solutions and explore alternative approaches.
